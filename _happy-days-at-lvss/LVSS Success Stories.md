LVSS Success Stories
====================

#### **Excerpts from LVSS Students' Success Stories**

_After this student council bonding session, I really got to know many more other student councillors and made quite a lot of new friends._

**Shantel Lee Min Ki, 1E3**

_So for me this is success as now I know the importance of trying new things instead of doing nothing. I learnt that failure leads to success. It took multiple failures for me to pull up my socks and see progress._

**Ashraf Ali, 2A3**

_With a positive mind, I extended my right hand and shook theirs. When my turn came to explain to them on how to play one particular game, I overcame the fear of speaking in public and discharged my duty with great pride and confidence. Seeing the smiles they had on their faces, gave me the strength to do more for the school._

**Julia Sarah Binte Muhammad Hasan, Sec 3T1**Â 

_Embracing diversity has also taught me to become a better person and to be more accepting of others. When better relationships are built with others, it enables people like me to have a greater perspective and understanding of their culture and to be more sensitive towards others, which is who I am now!_

**Lycia Quek Yee Ling, 5A1**
