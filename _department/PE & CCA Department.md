### **Outdoor Education**

#### **Sec 2 Outdoor Adventure Camp (2021)**

The Sec 2 non-residential Camp this year was conducted in school premises (instead of overnight-camping style) following prevailing SMMs. Despite the restrictions and constraints, students had fun with the activities and bonded very well together. With bouldering-wall climbing as one of the activities in this year’s edition, participants managed to test their skills out safely and at the same time having fun with the support of their Secondary 3 Seniors from CCA Rock-climbing Club.

Check out snippets of their wonderful camp experiences here.

#### **Sports Education Programme (SEP)**

The SEP aims to advocate the importance of sports education, encourage sports participation in schools and increase sporting opportunities for the young. SEP sports programmes caters for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help promote active participation of sports in schools.

Helmed by the Enrichment and PE Department, the programmes planned in Loyang View also promote team spirit and character building, and aim to arouse interest in continual sports participation amongst students.

Students experience joy of learning through weekly enrichment programmes designed to develop their skills and interests in various domains and help them grow holistically as wholesome Loyang View students.
