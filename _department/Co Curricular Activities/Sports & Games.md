At Loyang View Secondary School, we believe that every basketball player is unique and has the potential to excel. Even though a player can quickly acquire the basic skills to play basketball, becoming a truly skilled player takes a lot of discipline and dedication. Therefore, having the right motivation is our key ingredient to continuously keep improving our players’ basketball skills.

_“I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.”_

(Michael Jordan)

During our training, the basketball team focuses both on the athletic aspects of the sport as well as on character building, leadership and sportsmanship. Values such as resilience, integrity and respect are instilled in every player throughout all our activities. Besides training, our players also have their share of fun during annual camps and team building activities to foster team spirit and strong camaraderie in the team.

**2020 Reflection**

Being a Captain of B Division, i was looking forward to attending CCA and participating in the

B-Division tournament as it will be my last year doing so. I will certainly miss playing basketball with my team as I feel that the passion we all had for this sport was what brought us together and helped us through the hard times as a team.

For this year East Zone competition, the whole team was pretty hyped as we were doing quite well and could tell that we had a chance to reach top-4. But our advancement was held back by the pandemic.

If we all could turn back time, i know for sure the whole team would say that they would have work harder last year to make it to top-4 so at least this year we wouldn't feel at loss so much.

I hope our juniors will carry on our legacy and make all of us proud because I know for sure they all have the talent and capabilities to grow and nurture to be better than us.

Lastly, I would like to thank the coach and teachers for their guidance and support.
