### Joy of Art @ LVSS
-----------------

Through positive learning experiences in art, students grow to become passionate in Art as they learn that Art beautifies, captures memories, communicates ideas, imparts values and evokes emotions.

1. **Ceramic Programmes**

Our volunteer, Ex-MP Mdm Cynthia Phua conducted a series of Ceramic Workshops for different groups of students to inspire them on the love of ceramic making. Students are inspired by her passion.

All our ec2s students worked together to create a large traditional batik in the ‘gotong–royong’ spirit. Wishing our school ‘A Happy & Caring School’
