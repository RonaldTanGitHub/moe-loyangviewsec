### Joy of Art @ LVSS
-----------------

Through positive learning experiences in art, students grow to become passionate in Art as they learn that Art beautifies, captures memories, communicates ideas, imparts values and evokes emotions.

1.Â **Ceramic Programmes**

Our volunteer, Ex-MP Mdm Cynthia Phua conducted a series of Ceramic Workshops for different groups of students to inspire them on the love of ceramic making. Students are inspired by her passion.
