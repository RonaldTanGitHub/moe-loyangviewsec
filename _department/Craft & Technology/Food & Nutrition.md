### Joy of Food & Nutrition @ LVSS
------------------------------

Signature programmes are specifically designed to provide positive experiences and develop passion for learning. Classroom activities are designed to nurture critical and creative thinking, encouraging the use of information technology and imbue a sense of national identity. Practical work in the classroom takes on an investigative approach where students use fundamental principles to design and create products to meet specific needs.

Loyang View Secondary School has been participating in this annual culinary competition organised by Keat Hong community Club. The theme for this year is “We are Singaporean” and participants were supposed to create a special sandwich related to the theme. Other than clinching one of the six prizes out of a total of 50 participating teams, all students have a memorable and meaning experience.
