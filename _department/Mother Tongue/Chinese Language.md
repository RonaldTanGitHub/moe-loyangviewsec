### CPES Activity: Story Challenge!《故事擂台》

##### (by The Theatre Practice实践剧场)
  

During post-EOY (15 Oct 2021), our CL teachers organised an enrichment activity for our Sec 1 and 2 students. The Theatre Practice brought the mind-bending, fast-talking madness of Story Challenge straight to our school. In a 60-minute performance (via Zoom), our students participated by contributing themes and conditions for the stories to be told by quick-thinking actors, who were given a mere five minutes to create each story!
