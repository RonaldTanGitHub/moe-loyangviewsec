### Malay Journalism & Broadcasting (J&B) Programme
-----------------------------------------------

This programme that started in 2019 hoped to enthuse students’ interest in the areas of Journalism and Broadcasting as well as enhance spoken interaction skills among students. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight, the Sec 1 Malay students put these skills to good use by producing an audio recording to advertise their Malay traditional food products while the Sec 2 Malay students created a video related to Malay traditional games. 

  

Here’s some examples of students’ work:



In addition to that, the Sec 1 students had a hands-on session where they learnt how to make epok-epok using plasticine. They then feasted on real epok-epok and ondeh-ondeh provided by the school.
