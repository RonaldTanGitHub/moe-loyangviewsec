### Malay Journalism & Broadcasting (J&B) Programme
-----------------------------------------------

This programme that started in 2019 hoped to enthuse students’ interest in the areas of Journalism and Broadcasting as well as enhance spoken interaction skills among students. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight, the Sec 1 Malay students put these skills to good use by producing an audio recording to advertise their Malay traditional food products while the Sec 2 Malay students created a video related to Malay traditional games. 

  

Here’s some examples of students’ work:



In addition to that, the Sec 1 students had a hands-on session where they learnt how to make epok-epok using plasticine. They then feasted on real epok-epok and ondeh-ondeh provided by the school.

Secondary 2 students challenged each other when they played some traditional games such as congkak, capteh and five stones.  
  
In Term 4, Secondary 1 students were introduced to batik and for their hands-on activity, they painted batik masks.   
  
Secondary 2 students participated in sewing their own five stones after learning about Malay traditional games.

### Hari Raya Celebration

Since Hari Raya Aidilfitri was celebrated at home, the school organised a Kahoot quiz via Zoom. Prior to that, students dedicated Hari Raya greetings to one another by giving each other Hari Raya cards.
