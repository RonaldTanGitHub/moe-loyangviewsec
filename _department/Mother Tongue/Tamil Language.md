### Deepavali Celebration 2021
--------------------------

Festivals are an expressive way to celebrate glorious heritage, culture and traditions. They are meant to rejoice special moments and emotions in our lives with our loved ones. They play an important role to add structure to our social lives, and connect us with our families and backgrounds.

  

Deepavali is celebrated by many Hindus observing the festival with social gatherings and food offerings to the gods at home and in temples throughout Singapore. 

  

In Loyang View Secondary School, we celebrate Deepavali in a unique way. Secondary One Students were involved in making a simple Deepavali Lamps with the usage of clay. 

  

Teachers also shared with students the meaning of Deepavali and why Hindus all over the world celebrate the festival. This sharing by teachers helps the younger generation to better understand and appreciate the common features shared by the different communities and foster a stronger sense of shared identity as Singaporeans. It also helps promote social cohesion and racial harmony in a multi-racial and multicultural society like Singapore.
