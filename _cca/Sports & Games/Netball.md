**CCA Description**  

Loyang View Netball (LVNB) aims to develop our girls to be disciplined and reflective netball players who should strive for excellence in all they do. 

Through the netball activities and values-driven programmes that were set in place, we hope to empower our netballers to not only be a better player in the sport but to also learn about key values like teamwork, perseverance and resilience. 

 Over the years, we are proud to announce that some of our girls have been talent-spotted to train with the zonal or national netball U-14 and U-17 developmental squad. With strong support from the school and stakeholders, the Loyang View Netball Team is committed to bring the CCA to greater heights.
