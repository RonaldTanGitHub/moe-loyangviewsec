| **About our CCA** |  |
| In line with the mission of the Boys’ Brigade and our school’s core values, the Boys’ Brigade (BB) 17th Singapore Company runs engaging programmes to develop our Boys into gracious and responsible leaders, imbued with a heart for adventure and community service. As part of a global uniformed group movement founded 1883 in Scotland, the BB has a long tradition of moulding Boys into men of good character.<br>Our Company strives to broaden our Boys’ experience with wide ranging outdoor and indoor activities. Activities with special focus on inculcating an adventurous and rugged spirit include kayaking, rock climbing, abseiling and archery. Captain’s Ball, cycling and other sports provide opportunities for fun and bonding. National education and first aid courses are also key programmes.<br>Annual highlight events include overnight camp and hike where Boys experience communal living and develop timeless values like teamwork. The annual participation in BB Share-a-Gift project is an avenue for service and care.<br>By the end of their journey with the Company, all of our Boys will be fully equipped with stronger character and wholistic life skills, ready to take on the challenges of their future studies and the exciting life ahead. |  |
