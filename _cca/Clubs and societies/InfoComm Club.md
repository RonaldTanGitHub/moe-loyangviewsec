### About the CCA
-------------

The InfoComm Club merges AV (Audio Visual), PVC (Photography and Videography) and Media Resource Library (MRL). Managed by a team of vibrant and dynamic teachers and aimed at leveraging technology for intellectual and social development, the club charts the course for the members’ infoComm  development, so that the school can effectively harness the opportunities presented by the emerging technologies and developments. There will also be many opportunities for the members to entrust themselves with the multi-disciplinary activities and tasks around infoComm that will become the key focus. The club will also continue to develop interesting and relevant training programmes to help the members keep themselves abreast of future infoComm directions and trends, identify opportunities and strengthen its edge, thus leveraging technology to make teaching, learning and co-curricular activities more pervasive and conducive in a Smart School. These training activities include photography, videography, coding and drone courses.  
  

**Goal**:   

*   To provide support for school events in both AVA and Photography services. 
*   To explore photography as an art medium.

**TIME AND DATE FOR THE CCA**

*   Tuesday 3pm - 5pm
*   Thursday 3pm - 5pm
*   Duty Schedule (Mon - Sun - depending on activities/events that require support; rostered)
