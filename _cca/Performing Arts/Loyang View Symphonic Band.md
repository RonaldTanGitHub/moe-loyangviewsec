About the CCA
-------------

Loyang View Symphonic Band was newly-formed from the merging of Greenview and Loyang Symphonic Bands in 2018. The band performs actively in school, taking the stage during National Day Parades, Commendation Day performances and more recently, “LVSB in Concert” in 2018. Additionally, the band serenades the public at outreach performances regularly, such as at Our Tampines Hub, and the Pasir East Community Centre for its National Day Commemoration in 2018. 

Our members also seek to develop their musicality by participating in external workshops and band festivals such as attending the WBAS Band Student Leader Workshops and the WBAS Youth Band Festival.
