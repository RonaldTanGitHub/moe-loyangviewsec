### Loyang View Secondary School Song

     
**Verse 1**

Marching to the beat of our nation’s drum,

We strive towards our calling.

To be a school that upholds

Our nation’s pride and glory.

**Chorus**

Loyang View, a happy school we are.

Where every life is touched,

and every moment treasured.

It’s a name we honour in word and deed.

We dare to face each challenge,

Learning to serve and lead.

**Verse 2**

Friends of all races we embrace,

Our hearts beating as one.

Steadfast in character,

With minds that are enlightened.

**Chorus**

Loyang View, a caring school we are.

Where every life is touched,

and every moment treasured.

It’s a name we honour in word and deed.

We dare to face each challenge,

Learning to serve and lead.

Within us lies the power,

To make our dreams come true.
