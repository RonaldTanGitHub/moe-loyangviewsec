### **Registration for Singpass for Graduating Students 2023**


The Sec 4/5 graduating students will take their GCE N-Level or O-Level examination this year and may participate in the admission exercises to apply for courses offered by the post-secondary education institutions, e.g. junior colleges, Millennia Institute, polytechnics or Institute of Technical Education. They will need to use their Singpass account to access the application portals to submit their application and view the posting results. They can also use their Singpass account to access their N-Level or O-Level examination results through Singapore Examinations and Assessment Boardâ€™s (SEAB) website. Please refer to the attached files for more details.

Please register for the Singpass account early, preferably by June 2023, for seamless access to the application portals or the SEAB website.
