Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
================================

  

### APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP) - SUSTAINABILITY

Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) journey started in 2014 to expose students to design-based science activities targeted at developing values and skill sets related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields.   

Sustainability is the key theme of our programme, as we seek to instill mindset of keeping Singapore sustainable for our future generations. The activities designed aim to be in line with one of United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals – **Affordable and Clean Energy**.

Students make use of the Design Thinking framework and learn to solve problems using scientific knowledge. They collaborate and communicate with different stakeholders such as school, family and community as well as engineer solutions that add value and seek to solve problems in these areas.

All these are accomplished through design-based science activities that the ALP Committee and Science Department has collaboratively crafted with STEM Inc.

#### _Junior Solar Sprint – Secondary One Students_

In Secondary One, students design and fabricate toy solar cars that are suitable for children 7-10 years of age.  Students are taken through a series of hands-on experiments to learn science and engineering concepts which they apply in the design and fabrication of their solar car.

### _Clean Energy Innovation – Secondary Two Students_

In Secondary Two, students are exposed to various clean energy sources through a series of hands-on activities and experiments.  Thereafter, they apply the science and engineering concepts learnt in their innovation of a toy/gadget that runs on clean energy.

### **Additional Workshops**

Beyond the school’s ALP curriculum, students get to participate in additional workshops conducted by external partners and vendors.

#### **2018 – Sec 2 Workshop by Fablab, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)**

In 2018, the Secondary 2 students also had the opportunity to undergo a 2-day workshop conducted by Fablab, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) where they had the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities and create gadgets demonstrating STEM understanding. Such activities are aimed at triggering thinking beyond the classroom and developing joy of learning.

#### _**Applied Sciences and Engineering – Secondary Three Students**_

In Secondary Three, students are given the opportunity to deepen their science knowledge in specialised areas of interest and apply their knowledge in real-life applications based on end-user needs. 

The programme aims to promote joy of learning and broaden students' interest various in STEM-related industries. In addition to learning new skills in Science and Technology, students are encouraged to think creatively and inventively as they build their prototypes for the showcase. They also got the opportunity to go on a learning journey to A\*Star and Seletar Airbase to see how scientists and aviation engineers work. 

Programmes offered each year are as listed below:

**2021** – 3D Printing, Drones and Life Sciences

**2019** – Biotechnolgy and Aeronautical Engineering

**2018** – Robotics, Sustainable Infrastructure and 3D Printing

**2017** – Robotics & Mechatronics, Biotechnology and Applied Food Sciences

#### **2021 – Drones, Cosmetics and 3D Printing**

Our Secondary 3 Express students participated in a six-week Applied Learning enrichment programme in 3D Printing, Drones and Life Sciences in 2021. Students took turns to participate in all three programmes, exposing them to more industries and broadening their learning experiences.

**2019 – Biotechnology, Aeronautical Engineering**

In 2019, our Secondary 3 Express students concluded their nine-week Applied Learning enrichment programme with a project showcase at the end of Term 1. The students were exposed to skills in Biotechnology and Aeronautical Engineering fields. In addition to learning new skills in Science and Technology, students were encouraged to think creatively and inventively as they built their prototypes for the showcase. They also got the opportunity to go on a learning journey to A\*Star and Seletar Airbase to observe how scientists and aviation engineers worked.
