Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
================================

  

### APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP) - SUSTAINABILITY

Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) journey started in 2014 to expose students to design-based science activities targeted at developing values and skill sets related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields.   

Sustainability is the key theme of our programme, as we seek to instill mindset of keeping Singapore sustainable for our future generations. The activities designed aim to be in line with one of United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals – **Affordable and Clean Energy**.
