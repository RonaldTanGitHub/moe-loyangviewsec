The Humanities Department oversees 3 subjects: Social Studies, Geography and History.  The department teachers engage students through Humanities Explorations to hone their critical thinking skills as well as inculcate values of good citizens to develop students into wholesome individuals.

  

### HUMANITIES EXPLORATIONS
-----------------------

The Humanities teachers promote students’ passion and joy in learning through designing engaging lessons and outdoor experiential learning aligned to curriculum objectives.

Students who have shown keen interest in Humanities were identified for the Humanities programme. They were provided opportunities to participate in competitions at the zonal and national level. For example, students took part in NUS Geography Challenge and Inter-School History Challenge.

The department Geography teachers organised a Sec 1 outdoor water testing activity aligned to the chapter on water supply. Other than promoting collaborative experiential learning, students learnt the importance of conservation.

**Secondary 2**  

The department History teachers organised trips to the museum for the students so that they can learn more about the topic on Japanese Occupation. For example, a collaborative History activity was conducted for the students at the Former Ford Factory.  The Geography teachers also designed a Geographical Investigation near the school in alignment to the Geography topic on housing for the students.

**Secondary 3**

The Humanities department led Humanities Overseas learning trips to promote joy in Humanities learning and to learn more about our neighbours.  The Express, N(A) and N(T) students who were involved in the overseas learning programme reflected their rich learning on History and Geography.  Their reflections demonstrated that they have learnt to appreciate multi-culturalism.

The Geography teachers brought students to places of interest in Singapore which aligned to the Sec 4 topic on tourism.  The students conducted their geographical investigation which allowed them to apply the content and skills learnt during lessons. Students completed the learning with greater confident to apply their learning in the GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ level examinations.
